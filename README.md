# Colorful People Quest: Curse of the Red Mage

This game was made with Phaser (http://phaser.io/) for the 50th Kongregate's Game in Ten Days. You can play the game here http://curseoftheredmage.kraiom.com/.

Although the code is far from being good, we think that the lighting code can be useful to someone else, since we couldn't find anything like that using Phaser. The code could be also used for a roguelike game.

Both the code and the graphics are under MIT license. The list of authors can be found in the AUTHORS file.

We would be thankful to know if you are using our project somehow, just for curiosity.
